# Network graph of a free market capitalist economy

Countless mechanisms work behind the scenes to make our modern day free market capitalist economies flourish. Economists like to describe economies as complex systems in a mathematical sense.

**Complex system**: *a system whose behavior is intrinsically difficult to model due to the dependencies, competitions, relationships, or other types of interactions between their parts or between a given system and its environment.*

In light of recent global increases to inflation, following years of quantitative easing by Western Central Banks, I set out to understand how this would affect all the various areas of the economy. What follows is a graphical depiction of the key mechanisms that shape a typical free market economy.

**Nodes in the network graph**

| Colour  | Represents |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Blue  | Market forces whose measurements are available to the public  |
| Orange | Market forces whose measurements are not available to the public  |
| Grey | Levers which institutions and governments can alter to shape the interactions of the other mechanisms of the economy  |


**Edges in the network graph**

| Colour  | Represents |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Blue  | Indicates a positive correlation between the nodes at the ends of the edge|
| Red | Indicates a negative correlation between the nodes at the ends of the edge |
| Grey | N/A - mechanism is agnostic to market conditions|
