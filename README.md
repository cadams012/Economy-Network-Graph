# Network graph of a free market capitalist economy

Countless mechanisms work behind the scenes to make our modern day free market capitalist economies flourish. Economists like to describe economies as complex systems in a mathematical sense.

**Complex system**: *a system whose behavior is intrinsically difficult to model due to the dependencies, competitions, relationships, or other types of interactions between their parts or between a given system and its environment.*

In light of recent global increases to inflation following years of quantitative easing by Western Central Banks, I set out to understand how this would affect all the various areas of the economy. What follows is a graphical depiction of the key mechanisms that shape a typical free market economy. Whilst this network is very far from a complete depiction of the enormity of the economy, it captures the key drivers behind much of what has been missed.

**Nodes in the network graph**

| Colour  | Represents |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Blue  | Market forces whose measurements are available to the public  |
| Orange | Market forces whose measurements are not available to the public  |
| Grey | Levers which institutions and governments can alter to shape the interactions of the other mechanisms of the economy  |


**Edges in the network graph**

| Colour  | Represents |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Blue  | Indicates a positive correlation between the nodes at the ends of the edge|
| Red | Indicates a negative correlation between the nodes at the ends of the edge |
| Grey | N/A - mechanism is agnostic to market conditions|

**Conclusion**

The graph reveals the dependency of modern day free market economies on traditional industries like oil and gas whose products are largely imported from overseas. Given the importance of such fuels for manufacturing and services, the economy is sensitive to any increase in price, as these price increases will translate to inflation, whose effect further propagates into mechanisms such as government bonds and bank lending.
